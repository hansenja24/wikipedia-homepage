    <h2>From today's featured article</h2>
    <p><a href="#"><strong>Corvus</strong></a> is a small <a href="#">constellation</a> in the <a href="#">Southern Celestial Hemisphere</a>. Its name means "raven" in Latin. In the
      Babylonian star catalogues dating from at least 1100 BCE, it was called the Babylonian Raven. One of the 48 c
      onstellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer Ptolemy, it depicts a raven, a bird associated with stories about
      the god Apollo, perched on the back of Hydra the water snake. It is also bordered by the constellations Virgo and
      Crater. Its four brightest stars, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon, and Beta Corvi, form a distinctive quadrilateral in the
      night sky. With an apparent magnitude of 2.59, Gamma Corvi—also known as Gienah—is the brightest star in the
      constellation. It is an aging blue giant around four times as massive as the Sun. The young star Eta Corvi has been
      found to have two debris disks. Three star systems have exoplanets, and a fourth planetary system is unconfirmed.
      TV Corvi is a dwarf nova—a white dwarf and brown dwarf in very close orbit. (Full article...) </p>

      <h2>Today's featured picture</h2>
      <p>A malachite kingfisher (Corythornis cristatus) at Lake Baringo, Kenya. Although many male birds have brighter colours than females, this is not the case with the malachite kingfisher; both sexes are equally colourful. When fishing, these birds often perch less than a metre above the water, diving in once they spot fish, aquatic insects, or crustaceans to prey upon.</p>
